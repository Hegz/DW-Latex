The current target is for less then 50 pages of double sided Legal sized paper.

## License
See the LICENSE file for the full details, but here's the basics: you're free to use this text any way you like so long as you credit the authors.

What we hope you do with it is make new stuff: make classes, adventures, moves, even whole new games.
