# Dungeon World

Dungeon World is a tabletop roleplaying game by Sage LaTorra and Adem Koebel. The text this work is based off of is availible at https://github.com/SageIt/Dungeon-World

This version is designed for DIY printing.  I'm aiming for a high text density per page, but still keeping things readable. 

The current target is for less then 50 pages of double sided Legal sized paper.

See the LICENSE file for the full details, but here's the basics: you're free to use this text any way you like so long as you credit the authors.

What we hope you do with it is make new stuff: make classes, adventures, moves, even whole new games.
